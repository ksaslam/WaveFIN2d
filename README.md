# WaveFIN2d
This is a matlab code for solving anti-plane wave propagation in 2D. 
This code is written in matlab for two elastic blocks coupled by a frictional interface. 
The interface can support a maximum shear stress tau, otherwise slip occurs on the interface. 
Outer boundaries can be absorbing, free surface, or rigid by specifying a reflection coefficient.
