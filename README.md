# WaveFIN2d
This is a matlab code for solving wave propagation in 2D.
The waves are generated as a result of slip on a strike slip fault.
Since it is a 2D code, the problem is solved as anti-plane problem.
The fault is considered as a frictional interface which slips based on the slip weakening law. 
Outer boundaries can be absorbing, free surface, or rigid by specifying a reflection coefficient.
